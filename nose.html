  <p>I hated my nose for a long time. A long, long time. It's large and pointy, and, it's what, on a man, would be called "strong" or "aquiline" -- on a petite woman, it looks out of place, or so I thought. A friend once avoided the question of whether I had an ugly nose by telling me that I have a nice personality. I hated my nose.
<br />
    For a really long time, I would only let people take pictures of me from head-on; I avoided shots of my profile at all costs. I looked up makeup techniques that would somehow minimize the appearance of my nose. I kept my hair long so that I could tilt my head and let my hair fall forward, covering my face. I thought about getting a nose job. My grandmother once told me to get a nose job. Or rather, she said, "Annie, you only live once, and you only get one body. If surgery will make you feel happier living in the body you've been given, then more power to you."
<br />
I am learning, albeit slowly. Over the past year or two my nose has gone from being this huge blemish on my face to being something about myself that I like a lot. It's different, and it makes my face more interesting. It gives me character, makes me appear somehow both dignified and a bit oddball. It just plain looks kinda good.</p>
